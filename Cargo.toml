# Our OS defines success/failure codes for QEMU isa-debug-exit as:
#   - Success: 0x10
#   - Failure: 0x11
#
# And QEMU returns exit code as (app_code << 1) | 1.
#
# So, QEMU's exit code for success/failure would be:
#   - Success: 0x21 / 33 (0x10 << 1 | 1)
#   - Failure: 0x23 / 35 (0x11 << 1 | 1)
#
# So, redefine exit_code 33 to mean tests passed.
